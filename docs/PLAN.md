# Current plan

## Numbered runs

- **1 — SAC + Gazebo + DiSECt**: resumed training in SliceIt
  `runs/sac_resume_20261103`, loading the retained TensorFlow checkpoint and
  replay buffer. The source run endpoint remains 100100 environment steps with
  the existing 72-hour execution deadline.
  W&B [xofe4ps8](https://forge.coreweave.com/wandb/ju-dong6276-technical-university-of-munich/sliceit-supermimic/runs/xofe4ps8).
- **2 — SuperMimic + Gazebo + DiSECt**: stopped at iteration 872/update 316
  after critic divergence. Frozen episode return and bootstrap probes identify
  large value bias and terminal-head errors. The relative causal contributions
  remain to be established; single-world data reuse is a measured regime difference.
- **3 — SuperMimic + MuJoCo Warp + DiSECt**: stopped at vector step 122,
  124928 physical transitions, zero learner updates and zero completed episodes.
  The transition-rescaled schedule is removed. The implementation now uses the
  pinned source vector-step cadence and 1000 replay rows per environment.
- Run 1 training stays on ROS 11321/Gazebo 11355. Frozen SAC evaluation uses
  separate ROS 11323/Gazebo 11357 and the source ten-episode deterministic evaluator.

## Current implementation

The world model predicts 36 coordinates: joint position/velocity, observed wrench
history and interval peak wrench. Ten frames supply 480 physical/command inputs.
The 860-coordinate rollout state also retains analytic observation/reward history
and success count. Particles remain in DiSECt and recorded data. Source widths,
effective batches 2048/4096, eight-step model fitting, 32-step BPTT, learning rates,
update ratio and task thresholds are unchanged. Microbatch 64 controls storage.

Both runs use the repaired post-step and zero-time reset joint snapshots.
Shutdown independently saves artifacts, closes the environment within wall-time
bounds and finishes W&B; a run-specific guard cleans up remaining child processes.
The completed SAC task check had 31 transitions, 30 updates, return 84.00210,
reset pose/history errors 0 and force-read errors 0. Old failed SAC checkpoint
files were deleted; diagnostic logs and replay remain. New world-model metadata
uses `synchronous_paused_joint_snapshot_v1` and rejects incompatible recordings
or resumed checkpoints.

## Next work

1. Restore the pinned vector-step schedule and audit a full learner update against
   the source. Check losses, gradients, critic sample order and parameter updates
   with identical inputs and weights. Keep the task reward, thresholds and optimizers.
2. Use the saved failed episodes and checkpoints to separate model prediction,
   terminal probability and critic bootstrap errors. Diagnose with frozen inputs;
   make one repair only when the corresponding failure is reproduced.
3. Check the repaired connected model in physical episodes, then evaluate sustained
   learning with a frozen policy and the original task metrics. Short numerical
   checks establish implementation behavior; completed physical episodes establish
   task outcomes.
4. Complete frozen SAC evaluation cleanup independently of SuperMimic work.

Implementation differences are in METHOD; commands and numbers are in RESULTS.
