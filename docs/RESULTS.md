Collector `9e7273d`, SuperMimic-Reproduced `ba610534`, DiSECt `db7de0f`.
`collect_disect.py --config ../configs/public_prism.json --disect-root .
--output /dataHDD/dong/Projects/CuttingWorldModel/runs/prism_straight`:
1.3 s, 26 control intervals, 1187 vertices, 304 springs, 281 released at the
endpoint; peak force 10.3782 N, wall time 87.10 s while SAC was also running.
Full positions, velocities, remaining spring stiffness, knife pose/twist and
force are stored in `runs/prism_straight/trajectory.npz`.

`check_state_restart.py --dataset runs/prism_straight --frame 13`:
110 springs released at restart. One-step position RMS/max difference
3.78e-8/3.80e-7 m; velocity RMS/max 4.39e-5/6.17e-4 m/s; spring stiffness
RMS/max 0.00572/0.07373. Record: `restart_check.json`.

The imported upstream MLP has 38,888,720 parameters and a 7440-dimensional
cutting state. An untrained 8-step forward/backward interface check took
0.396 s on two CPU threads; parameter gradients were finite, L2 norm 0.05788.
Its identity-initialized prediction equals state persistence: particle-position
RMSE 0.125 mm, force RMSE 2.988 N over that window. Record: `model_interface.json`.
Trained held-out prediction and policy optimization are the next experiments.

During additional physics collection, GPU utilization reached 98% and one
SAC episode took 96.22 s for 22 steps, versus about 1.76 s/step beforehand.
The collector exited after one trajectory. Further large physics collection
must be scheduled rather than continuously competing with the SAC baseline.
